            <a href="https://www.bitsathy.ac.in/departments/details/OTM4MzU0MA=="><h2>COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY</h2></a>
            <P>A combination of computer related hardware or software such as multimedia computers, different types of media (graphics, audios and videos) and networked communication tools 
            (email, bulletin boards, Blackboard or WebCT, and listserves), together in an educational setting in order to enhance language learning.</P>
            <h2>DAY SKILL</h2>
            <P>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within 
            a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables<BR><BR>This is because HTML is not a programming language. Unfortunately, coding only in 
            HTML doesn't make you a programmer. In fact, HTML really shines when you use it in conjunction with an actual programming language, such as when using a web framework.</P>
